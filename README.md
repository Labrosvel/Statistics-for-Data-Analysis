# EDA for group of students
Creating the dataframe with the variables, Calculating relative and absolute frequency and plotting the empirical distribution functions 

# EDA for bus accidents
Compute mean and median from a distribution for bus accidents

# EDA - iris dataset
In the iris dataset (available in R) we conduct EDA by:
1.Computing descriptive analysis, calculating mean,stdev,median and IQR for all numerical and relative frequency table for all nominal variables
2.Represent the data graphically for EDA using plots,boxplot and hist
3.Calculating the correlation matrix

# Homework
In this homework we analyse 3 different problems
1. Resistances with avg(R)=0.13 ohms and sd=0.005 ohms follow normal distribution. Find confidence intervals and probabilities
2. P(recovery)=0.8 for a patient. N=20 patients with the desease. Find probabilities that exactly (or at least 14 people will survive
3. Fisherman catches approx. 10 fishes per hour (Poisson). Find min time to wait for catching 4 fishes with 90% confidence

# Homework 2
Using probability theory and sampling statistics.
1. The probability for a patient to recover after receiveing a drug is 0:5. 200 experiments are performed with 50 patients each. Simulate the outcome of these experiments using the rbinom function and draw a histogram of the sample proportions from the experiments. Repeat the procedure when the probability of success of the drug is 0.95 and comment
on the difference.
