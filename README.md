# EDA for group of students
Creating the dataframe with the variables, Calculating relative and absolute frequency and plotting the empirical distribution functions 

# EDA for bus accidents
Compute mean and median from a distribution for bus accidents

# EDA - iris dataset
In the iris dataset (available in R) we conduct EDA by:
1.Computing descriptive analysis, calculating mean,stdev,median and IQR for all numerical and relative frequency table for all nominal variables
2.Represent the data graphically for EDA using plots,boxplot and hist
3.Calculating the correlation matrix

# 10. Homework
In this homework we analyse 3 different problems
1. Resistances with avg(R)=0.13 ohms and sd=0.005 ohms follow normal distribution. Find confidence intervals and probabilities
2. P(recovery)=0.8 for a patient. N=20 patients with the desease. Find probabilities that exactly (or at least 14 people will survive
3. Fisherman catches approx. 10 fishes per hour (Poisson). Find min time to wait for catching 4 fishes with 90% confidence
